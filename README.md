# How to use main.py:
When running the main.py file, you will encounter an interface that will guide you through the process of creating your own Linear Regression. On the main menu, you are given 5 options:

```
Option 1: Change the initial learning rate
Option 2: Change the number of iterations
Option 3: Change gradient tolerance
Option 4: Run Simple linear regression
Option 5: Run Polynomial regression
Option 6: Exit
```

By pressing the corresponding key, you can enter the different options. The program will always run using the values:
* Learning rate = 0.1;
* Number of iterations = 10000;
* Gradient tolerance = 0.00001;

unless they are changed using one of the first three options.

## Option 1: Change the initial learning rate
This option will print the current learning rate and allow you to enter a new initial learning rate. This value must be a positive float.

## Option 2: Change the number of iterations
This option will print the current number of iterations and allow you to enter a new number. This value must be a positive integer.

## Option 3: Change gradient tolerance
This option will print the current gradient tolerance and allow you to enter a new number. This value must be a positive float.

## Option 4: Run Simple linear regression
When selecting option 4, the interface asks if you want to add a prediction. If 'no' is selected, the program starts running. When 'yes' is selected, you can add a timestep in which you want to predict the position. 

## Option 5: Run Polynomial regression
When selecting option 5, the interface asks if you want to add a prediction. If 'no' is selected, the program starts running. When 'yes' is selected, you can add a timestep in which you want to predict the position.

## Option 6: Exit
When option 6 is selected, the program will stop running.
